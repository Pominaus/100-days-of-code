# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 22nd May, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learnt some git bash commands to become more comfortable with git version control and not just github.

**Thoughts:** This was important to me as the first time I attempted this challenge I didn't really know git, and just figured out how to use github. Instead I focused on keeping a blog, that really was too big a commitment to keep up daily. I was worrying about screenshots and SRO and maintaining my blog all just to post today's progress. When I started to get behind on my posts, it added to the pressure. This time around I want to learn from the mistakes made before and track my progress here and just focus on the code. I will instead use my blog for a "things I learnt this week" summary, rather than a daily post. 

With that in mind, to kick off this challenge, I thought I'd start by getting to know git a little better. This is day 1 of 2 I intend to spend on git, and today I was only dealing with local repo's. I got quite comfotable with the working directory, staging area and the repository, as well as a deeper understanding of merging branches, .gitignore, and recovering mistakes in the working directory from the staging area.
