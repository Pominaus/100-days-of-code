# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 1, 2017#####

**Today's Progress**: Created a blog to act as my log, attempted two challenges on codewars.

**Thoughts:** https://www.jonsdevblog.com

**Link to work:** (can't currently work out how to find code I've already submitted on codewars - I shall add to github before moving on in future!)
